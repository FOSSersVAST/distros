# Knoppix

KNOPPIX is an operating system based on Debian designed to be run directly from a CD / DVD (Live CD) or a USB flash drive (Live USB), one of the first of its kind for any operating system. Knoppix was developed by, and named after, Linux consultant Klaus Knopper. When starting a program, it is loaded from the removable medium and decompressed into a RAM drive. The decompression is transparent and on-the-fly.

Although KNOPPIX is primarily designed to be used as a Live CD, it can also be installed on a hard disk like a typical operating system. Computers that support booting from USB devices can load KNOPPIX from a live USB flash drive or memory card.

There are two main editions: the traditional compact-disc (700 megabytes) edition and the DVD (4.7 gigabytes) "Maxi" edition. Each main edition has two language-specific editions: English and German.

Version 8.1 of KNOPPIX is based on the usual picks from Debian stable (stretch), testing (buster) and unstable (sid) for newer graphics drivers or desktop software packages. It uses Linux kernel 4.12.7 and Xorg 7.7 (core 1.19.3) for supporting current computer hardware.

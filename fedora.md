# Fedora

Fedora is a Linux distribution developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat. Fedora contains software distributed under various free and open-source licenses and aims to be on the leading edge of such technologies. Fedora is the upstream source of the commercial Red Hat Enterprise Linux distribution.

Since the release of Fedora 21, three different editions are currently available: Workstation, focused on the personal computer, Server for servers, and Atomic focused on cloud computing.

As of February 2016, Fedora has an estimated 1.2 million users, including Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel.

## Software

Fedora comes installed with a wide range of software such as LibreOffice and Firefox. Additional software is available from the software repositories and can be installed using the DNF package manager or GNOME Software.
Additionally, extra repositories can be added to the system, so that software not available in Fedora can be installed easily. Software that is not available via official Fedora repositories, either because it doesn't meet Fedora's definition of free software or because its distribution may violate US law, can be installed using third-party repositories. Popular third-party repositories include RPM Fusion free and non-free repositories. Fedora also provides users with an easy-to-use build system for creating their own repositories called Copr.

Since the release of Fedora 25, the operating system defaults to the Wayland display server protocol, which replaced the X Window System.

## Reviews

#### Fedora is always free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.

```
Fedora is the 2nd most popular Linux distribution ever. It is built and used across the globe who work together as a community. Also can be used by anyone just like Ubuntu.

#### Fedora is awesome
```
Perhaps the main thing about Fedora is that it does not try to have its own shiny pieces of software, but tries as much to contribute at upstream. weâ€™ll probably find many of the following features in many other Linux distributions as well,but many were done by the Fedora community.

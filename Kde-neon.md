# KDE Neon

KDE neon is a set of software repositories for Ubuntu long-term support (LTS) releases with latest 64-bit version of KDE desktop and applications.It is also the name given to a Ubuntu LTS-based Linux distribution that utilizes said repositories.It aims to provide the users with rapidly updated Qt and KDE software, while updating the rest of the OS components from the Ubuntu repositories at the normal pace. It comes in user and developer editions.

The KDE neon Linux distribution is focused on the development of KDE. The emphasis is on bleeding edge software packages sourced directly from KDE and offers programmers early access to new features, but potentially at the cost of greater susceptibility to software bugs.

KDE neon announced in January 2017 that the distribution switching its installer from Ubiquity to Calamares due to Ubiquity "not having some features".

In February 2018, KDE neon developers removed the LTS Editions from the downloads page, but kept these editions in the download mirrors because "many people asking and doubt, which editions is recommended, and what the differences".

In May 2018, KDE started moving basing KDE neon from Ubuntu 16.04 to Ubuntu 18.04.[16] KDE neon preview images, which basing on Ubuntu 18.04, became available in August 2018.

## Reviews

#### Differences from Kubuntu

```
Because Kubuntu has the KDE Plasma suite on a Ubuntu base OS, KDE neon often is mistaken for Kubuntu and vice versa. However, the primary difference between the two operating systems is that Kubuntu maintains stable releases and LTS version of Ubuntu while KDE neon focuses on updating developer editions of KDE applications without maintaining stable releases of Ubuntu unless the root user actively chooses to upgrade their systems.

#### Graphical user interface

```
The graphical user interface (GUI),The interface which replace cryptic command by their graphical representation is called GUI, it is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces (CLIs), which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard.

The actions in a GUI are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements. Beyond computers, GUIs are used in many handheld mobile devices such as MP3 players, portable media players, gaming devices, smartphones and smaller household, office and industrial controls. The term GUI tends not to be applied to other lower-display resolution types of interfaces, such as video games (where head-up display (HUD) is preferred), or not including flat screens, like volumetric displays because the term is restricted to the scope of two-dimensional display screens able to describe generic information, in the tradition of the computer science research at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.

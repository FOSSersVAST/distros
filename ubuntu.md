Ubuntu releases a new version every 6 months, April (.04) and October (.10). The version names are based on year and month of release. Example : `Ubuntu 18.04 means it was released on 2018 April.`

Ubuntu releases a **Long Term Support** (LTS) version every 2 years. `Ubuntu 14.04`, `Ubuntu 16.04`, `Ubuntu 18.04` are LTS releases. They're supported for **5 years**. Hence LTS releases are **recommended for installation**.

The latest LTS release **Ubuntu 18.04** is supported until 2023. You can [download it here](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/).

## Reviews

#### The most popular distro

```
Ubuntu is the most popular Linux distribution ever. Because it is simple to install and use. I like Ubuntu, but I dislike the new GNOME 3 desktop environment. It's too heavy !

Yeah, I've first used Linux via the Famous "Ubuntu". Has a nice Purple/Magenta ambience which makes it stand out from other OSs(Windows).
The TaskBar on the side, did take some time to get used to.
Ubuntu seeming to be a parent for many distros has its quirks as most Softwares developed for Linux works perfectly fine on Ubuntu, thanks to the Active Open Source community.

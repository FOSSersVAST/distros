# Kali Linux

Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security Ltd. It was developed by Mati Aharoni and Devon Kearns of Offensive Security through the rewrite of BackTrack, their previous information security testing Linux distribution based on Knoppix. 

Kali Linux is developed using a secure environment with only a small number of trusted people that are allowed to commit packages, with each package being digitally signed by the developer. Kali also has a custom-built kernel that is patched for 802.11 wireless injection. This was primarily added because the development team found they needed to do a lot of wireless assessments. Kali Linux is based on Debian Testing. Most packages Kali uses are imported from the Debian repositories.

## Reviews

####  Mainly used for fair penetration test and vulnerability analysis.
```
Kali Linux is specifically tailored to the needs of penetration testing professionals, and therefore all documentation on this site assumes prior knowledge of, and familiarity with, the Linux operating system in general.
However, if you’re a professional penetration tester or are studying penetration testing with a goal of becoming a certified professional, there’s no better toolkit — at any price — than Kali Linux.

####  Network Breach and Security Testing
```
Kali Linux was made to suit the needs of Network penetration White Hat (hackers)
by pre-installing famous tools used for the purpose such as AIRCRACK-NG, jSQL-Injection and so on. This makes the user more free to chose an appropriate tool for testing rather than looking for workarounds (which can get tedious).
Although Kali Linux isn't one on the top when Design comes into the scene, but is a outweighed by is powerful software punch.

#### Popular for hacking and network security
```
Kali Linux is an advanced penetration testing Linux distribution used for penetration testing, ethical hacking and network security assessments.
It has gained a lot of popularity recently. And there is a reason for that, Hacking is back as the cool-thing-to-do in popular culture.Kali is one of the few hacking focused Linux distributions.And with that, people with hardly any knowledge of Linux or anything related to computer security are now trying to use Kali as their main Linux distribution.

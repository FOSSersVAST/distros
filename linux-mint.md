# Linux Mint

Linux Mint is a community-driven Linux distribution based on Debian and Ubuntu that strives to be a "modern, elegant and comfortable operating system which is both powerful and easy to use."

Linux Mint provides full out-of-the-box multimedia support by including some proprietary software and comes bundled with a variety of free and open-source applications.

Linux Mint is a stable, robust, and elegant Ubuntu-based distribution.

Linux Mint is a great ‘default’ distro for new Linux users, as it comes with a lot of the software you’ll need when switching from Mac or Windows, such as LibreOffice, the favoured productivity suite of Linux users. It also has better support for proprietary media formats, allowing you to play videos, DVDs and MP3 music files out of the box.

A strong option for those new to Linux

Linux Mint releases are timed to be approximately one month after Ubuntu releases . Consequently, every Linux Mint release comes with an updated version of both GNOME and X and features some of the improvements brought in the latest Ubuntu release.

The latest release is Linux Mint 19 "Tara", released on 29 June 2018. As an LTS release, it will be supported until 2023, and it is planned that future versions until 2020 will use the same package base, making upgrades easy.

Linux Mint comes in 3 different flavours, each featuring a different desktop environment.

Cinnamon 
>The most popular version of Linux Mint is the Cinnamon edition. Cinnamon is primarily developed for and by Linux Mint. It is slick, beautiful, and full of new features.

MATE
>A more stable, and faster desktop.

Xfce
>Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment. It doesn’t support as many features as Cinnamon or MATE, but it’s extremely stable and very light on resource usage.

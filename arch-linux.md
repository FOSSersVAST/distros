# Arch Linux

Arch Linux is composed predominantly of free and open-source software,and supports community involvement.

The design approach of the development team follows the KISS principle ("keep it simple, stupid") as the general guideline, and focuses on elegance, code correctness, minimalism and simplicity, and expects the user to be willing to make some effort to understand the system's operation.A package manager written specifically for Arch Linux, pacman, is used to install, remove and update software packages.

Arch Linux uses a rolling release model, such that a regular system update is all that is needed to obtain the latest Arch software; the installation images released by the Arch team are simply up-to-date snapshots of the main system components.

Arch Linux has comprehensive documentation in the form of a community wiki known as the ArchWiki.

## Reviews

#### Arch Linux is perfect for "Beginners"

```
I have been hearing about Arch for a long while and  their users are very enthusiastic in trying to convince other people to join. Well, i found realized that Arch is good for advanced users, but also for beginners. But not because it is easy .On the contrary: it's because it is hard in the right way.

## Reviews

#### NixOS is based on the Nix package manager that stores all packages in isolation from each other in the package store. 

```
I very much like the way NixOS takes the worry out of upgrading packages by placing each change in its own "generation"

#### flexible GNU/Linux-based distribution 
```
It has ease of deployment and reproducibility of the system.But with poor documentation, making it hard to create new packages, services or builds on the Hydra CI service.
